/** Core Kyo examples demonstrating fundamental effects and patterns.
  *
  * This package contains examples showcasing:
  *   - File I/O operations with `Sync` and `Abort` effects
  *   - Concurrent programming with `Fiber` and `Async`
  *   - Looping constructs and stream processing
  *   - Timing and scheduling with `Clock`
  *
  * Each example is a standalone application extending `KyoApp` and can be run independently to explore different Kyo capabilities.
